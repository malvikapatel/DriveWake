# DriveWake - Real-Time Drowsiness Detector 

## The purpose of DriveWake is to alert a driver when they feel drowsy or sleepy. Hence, DriveWake acts as a safety protocol for drivers especially in cars to prevent accidents.

## The project was built using Python and the OpenCV library was used to gather images from a webcam and these images are then given to a Deep Learning Model which detects if the eyes in the images are "Open" or "Closed".
